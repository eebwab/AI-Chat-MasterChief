# AI-Chat-MasterChief

**AI-Chat-MasterChief** is an interactive chatbot built to simulate conversations with Master Chief from the Halo universe, powered by Google's Dialogflow API. This project demonstrates my skills in API integration, natural language processing (NLP), and Python development. It showcases my ability to build full-stack applications from scratch and implement secure, real-time communication systems.

## Key Features
- **Conversational AI:** Utilizes Google's Dialogflow for natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP).
- **Real-time Chatbot:** Interact with the chatbot in real-time through text-based communication.
- **API Integration:** Seamless interaction with Google Cloud services, managing API requests and responses.
- **Secure API Key Management:** Implements best practices in securing sensitive information (e.g., using `.gitignore` to exclude API keys).
  
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The core programming language used to build the chatbot and manage the backend logic.
- **Google Dialogflow API:** Used for NLU and NLP to process user inputs and generate responses from Master Chief.
- **Flask:** Lightweight web framework for handling API requests.
- **Pandas:** Used to parse and scrape intents from CSV files to automate fine-tuning and training of model
- **HTML/CSS:** Build a simple yet appealing frontend for the user to enjoy.
- **Virtual Environment:** Python's `venv` module to manage dependencies in an isolated environment.
- **Git:** Version control for managing project code and collaboration.
